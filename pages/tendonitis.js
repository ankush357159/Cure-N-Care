            Tendinitis is a condition where the connective tissues between your
            muscles and bones (tendons) become inflamed. Often caused by
            repetitive activities, tendinitis can be painful. It commonly
            happens in the elbow, knee, shoulder, hip, Achilles tendon and base
            of the thumb. Tendinitis is also called tendonitis.

            Anyone can get tendinitis. However, it&apos;s more common in those
            who do repetitive activities. Some of these activities include:

            Athletes who participate in certain sports, such as tennis, golf,
            bowling, or basketball, are at a higher risk of tendinitis. You may
            also be at a higher risk if your job requires physical exertion,
            overhead lifting, or repetitive motions or tasks.

            The pain from tendinitis is typically a dull ache concentrated
            around the affected area or joint. It increases when you move the
            injured area. The area will be tender, and youâ€™ll feel increased
            pain if someone touches it.
